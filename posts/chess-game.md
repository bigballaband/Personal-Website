This was a school group project created with 2 of my friends. The goal was to use Object Oriented programming to create a Chess game, with 4 level bots. We only ended up creating 3 bots, however, since we used unique pointers, we were able to get extra marks and score 100.8% on the assignment. For the first part of the assignment, we needed to create a design flowchart to plan out how we were going to implement our code. We decided to use an Observer pattern for the game, where the board is an observer of all the pieces, and we had to implement a graphical and text display interface, so the graphical and text display interfaces were observers of the board.
