First entry, June 25th, 2023:
I decided to create this project because of my two passions; lifting and coding. I have always been inspired to create an app; in high school, I attempted to start but I had no real interests in anything and I was a stubborn teenager with no drive. Now, I have realized my passion for coding and math is as strong as my passion for sports and working out. I am going to use Objective-C to create this project with the timeline of it being complete by the end of August. The purpose of this app is to track workouts that I do during my training splits, so I don't have to write anything down or use the notes on my phone.

Second entry, July 23rd, 2023:
The design of the app is complete. Currently it is a simple to do list app, I am going to add features to this app for different days, such as push day, pull day etc. I decided to use React Native to create the app, I was having difficulty using Objective-C. I plan to complete the app in the coming weeks, now that I have no courses to worry about.
